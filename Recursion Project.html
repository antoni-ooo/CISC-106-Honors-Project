        is a peculiar function-writing paradigm that asks programmers to do the
        unintuitive when designing functions:
        <em
          >to declare a function call to the very function they're defining, within said definition!
        </em>
        <br />
        <br />
        Although paradoxical on its face, recursion is a powerful tool in a
        programmer's tool-belt that allows one the ability to navigate data
        structures, and in our case, construct very cool fractal graphics
        in a way that would be difficult to achieve by other means! :]

      <p class="article-p">This first target graphic resembles a quilt-like pattern, and is ultimately achieved through the primary establishment of a "base square" from which our recursive function can construct its larger picture from.</p>
      <p class="article-p">As with every recursive function, it is imperative to account for a <em>base case</em> that our function can look towards for resolution.</p>
      <p class="article-p">In this case, we want our base case to instruct DrRacket to create a solid square whose color is directly pulled from the first element of our argument list:</p>
      <img class="carpet code" src="Images/Carpet Code.jpg" alt="Sierpiński Carpet DrRacket Code">
      <p>Under the same cond statement, we can further instruct DrRacket to populate an image using two things:
        <ol>
          <li>A recursive call to this function, with the rest of our list</li>
          <li>A solid square, whose dimensions corresponds to the size of our recursive call and is painted according to the first element of our argument list</li>
        </ol>
        We then take advantage of the <em>above</em> and then <em>beside</em> syntax to populate our Sierpiński Carpet!:

      <p class="article-p">Our second recursive graphic aims to recreate a snowflake pattern.</p>
      <p class="article-p">This go around, we're going to want our "base case" to return a very tiny, solid square. </p>
      <p class="article-p">When considering how we're going to go about constructing a snowflake-ian curve from a square, we're going to want to concede that we're not going to construct a line. Rather, we're going to create the illusion of curves via the rotation of base-squares and recursive calls.</p>
      <p class="article-p">Fortunately for us this can be achieved using "beside/align":</p>
      <img src="Images/Curve Code.jpg" alt="Koch Curve DrRacket Code">
      <p class="article-p">After a few layers of recursion we're able to achieve a shape that's beginning to resemble a snowflake <em>(6 instances of recursion here)</em>:</p>

      <p class="article-p">Having achieved this much, it isn't too much more work to construct our snowflake from here.</p>
      <p class="article-p">Considering the symmetrical nature of snowflakes, we're able to construct our snowflake by positioning three different calls to our previously created function in relation to one another as such:</p>

      <p class="article-p">This graphic is a popular recursive graphic, but is surprisingly complicated to achieve in DrRacket due to the nature of how these shapes and images are created.</p>
      <p class="article-p">Despite this, we will want to begin this task as we would with any other recursive function: we want to account for a base case.</p>
      <p class="article-p">For our purposes of constructing a tree, we will have our base case return us a "leaf" that is entirely just a solid, green rectangle as our means of indicating completion:</p>
      <img src="Images/Tree Code.jpg" alt="Tree DrRacket Code">
      <p class="article-p">Additionally, we're going to change the template of our function parameters: we're going to account for a <em>"num"</em> and for a <em>"length"</em>.</p>
      <p class="article-p">We'll create some internal definitions within the function that give us the arithmetic needed to construct trees in such a way that they do not deconstruct <em>(positioning in DrRacket can be tricky for these kinds of things. If recursive rectangles are too big in this function they will cause the tree to quite literally break apart and deform, hence the need for "new-length")</em></p>
      <p class="article-p">Considering that this function will be retuning our "leafs" upon <em>num = 1</em>, we have our function build our tree by dynamically creating solid, brown rectangles of <em>new-length</em> lengths.</p>
      <p class="article-p">Arithmetic aside, the remainder of this function is rather straight-forward. We can achieve our desired fractal by taking advantage of <em>above</em>, <em>beside</em>, and <em>rotate</em>:</p>
