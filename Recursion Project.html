        >
        is a peculiar function-writing paradigm that asks programmers to do the
        unintuitive when designing functions:
        <em
          >to declare a function call to the very function they're defining, within said definition!
        </em>
        <br />
        <br />
        Although paradoxical on its face, recursion is a powerful tool in a
        programmer's tool-belt that allows one the ability to navigate data
        structures, and in our case, construct very cool fractal graphics
        in a way that would be difficult to achieve by other means! :]

      <p class="article-p">This first target graphic resembles a quilt-like pattern, and is ultimately achieved through the primary establishment of a "base square" from which our recursive function can construct its larger picture from.</p>
      <p class="article-p">As with every recursive function, it is imperative to account for a <em>base case</em> that our function can look towards for resolution.</p>
      <p class="article-p">In this case, we want our base case to instruct DrRacket to create a solid square whose color is directly pulled from the first element of our argument list:</p>
      <img class="carpet code" src="Images/Carpet Code.jpg" alt="Sierpiński Carpet DrRacket Code">
      <p>Under the same cond statement, we can further instruct DrRacket to populate an image using two things:
        <ol>
          <li>A recursive call to this function, with the rest of our list</li>
          <li>A solid square, whose dimensions corresponds to the size of our recursive call and is painted according to the first element of our argument list</li>
        </ol>
        We then take advantage of the <em>above</em> and then <em>beside</em> syntax to populate our Sierpiński Carpet!:

      <p class="article-p">Our second recursive graphic aims to recreate a snowflake pattern.</p>
      <p class="article-p">This go around, we're going to want our "base case" to return a very tiny, solid square. </p>
      <p class="article-p">When considering how we're going to go about constructing a snowflake-ian curve from a square, we're going to want to concede that we're not going to construct a line. Rather, we're going to create the illusion of curves via the rotation of base-squares and recursive calls.</p>
      <p class="article-p">Fortunately for us this can be achieved using "beside/align":</p>
      <img src="Images/Curve Code.jpg" alt="Koch Curve DrRacket Code">
      <p class="article-p">After a few layers of recursion we're able to achieve a shape that's beginning to resemble a snowflake <em>(6 instances of recursion here)</em>:</p>

      <p class="article-p" id="recursive-calls"><em class="recur-calls">6 recursive calls</em></p>
      <p class="article-p">Having achieved this much, it isn't too much more work to construct our snowflake from here.</p>
      <p class="article-p">Considering the symmetrical nature of snowflakes, we're able to construct our snowflake by positioning three different calls to our previously created function in relation to one another as such:</p>

      <p class="article-p">This graphic is a popular recursive graphic, but is surprisingly complicated to achieve in DrRacket due to the nature of how these shapes and images are created.</p>
      <p class="article-p">Despite this, we will want to begin this task as we would with any other recursive function: we want to account for a base case.</p>
      <p class="article-p">For our purposes of constructing a tree, we will have our base case return us a "twig" that is entirely just a solid, brown rectangle:</p>
